Project Description

    The goal for this project was to improve my software development skills 
    by creating a fun game called Ping Pong. This is a multiplayer game of Ping Pong 
    which is developed compeletly using Java.




Approach / What I did

    I began by splitting this projet into two steps. 
    
    Step 1 involved creating all the necessary objects needed for this project. This meant creating:

        Paddle Objects 
        Ball Object
        Game Panel
        Game Frame
